## How to Use These Agents

### 1. Create the Agent File

Create a new file in your repository's `.github/agents/` directory with the `.agent.yml` extension:

```bash
.github/agents/typescript-expert.agent.yml
```

### 2. Copy the Configuration

Copy the configuration from the appropriate agent file in this directory into your new agent file.

### 3. Invoke the Agent

**In GitHub Copilot Chat (VS Code):**
- Select the agent from the agent dropdown
- Ask questions or request assistance

**With Copilot CLI:**
```bash
gh copilot agent typescript-expert "Help me add type safety to this component"
```

**With Copilot Coding Agent:**
- Assign the agent to an issue or pull request
- The agent will work autonomously on the task

## Organization-Wide Agents

To make an agent available to your entire organization:

1. Create a `.github` repository in your organization (if it doesn't exist)
2. Add your agent files to `agents/` in that repository
3. All organization members can now use these agents

## Best Practices

### When Creating Custom Agents

1. **Be Specific**: Define clear expertise and scope for each agent
2. **Include Context**: Provide language-specific best practices and conventions
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test agents with various prompts before sharing
4. **Document Usage**: Include example prompts and use cases
5. **Iterate**: Refine agent instructions based on usage and feedback

### When Using Agents

1. **Choose the Right Agent**: Select the agent that matches your task
2. **Provide Context**: Give the agent enough information about your task
3. **Be Specific**: Clear, detailed prompts get better results
4. **Iterate**: Refine your prompts if the first response isn't quite right
5. **Combine Tools**: Agents can search, read files, and use other capabilities
