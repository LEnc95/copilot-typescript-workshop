## 📸 Scenario: Specialized AI Assistants at PixelPerfect Gallery

Your team at PixelPerfect Gallery works with multiple technologies and frameworks. Different team members specialize in different areas, and you need AI assistants that understand your specific tech stack and coding standards.

Today, you'll learn how to:
- Create specialized AI agents tailored to specific programming languages or frameworks
- Configure agents with expert knowledge and best practices
- Share agents across your team for consistent development practices
- Use agents in your workflow for autonomous task execution

## 🤖 Step 1: Understanding Custom Agents

### What are Custom Agents?

Custom agents are specialized AI assistants in GitHub Copilot that can be configured with specific expertise, instructions, and behaviors. Unlike the general-purpose Copilot, custom agents are designed for specific tasks, technologies, or workflows.

#### Key Capabilities:

- **Specialized Expertise**: Configure agents with deep knowledge of specific languages, frameworks, or domains
- **Autonomous Execution**: Agents can work independently on tasks, making multiple code changes
- **Tool Access**: Agents can search code, read files, edit code, and more
- **Organization-Wide**: Share agents across your entire organization for consistency
- **Multi-Context**: Use agents in VS Code, CLI, or with Copilot Coding Agent

#### Example Use Cases:

- A **TypeScript Expert** agent that enforces type safety and React best practices
- A **Security Reviewer** agent that scans for vulnerabilities and suggests fixes
- A **Testing Specialist** agent that generates comprehensive test suites
- A **Documentation Writer** agent that creates and updates docs based on code changes
- A **Database Expert** agent that helps with query optimization and migrations

### Why Custom Agents?

1. **Consistency**: Ensure all team members follow the same coding standards
2. **Efficiency**: Agents handle routine tasks autonomously
3. **Expertise**: Embed expert knowledge that's always available
4. **Quality**: Built-in best practices reduce code review cycles
5. **Onboarding**: New team members get expert guidance instantly

## 📝 Step 2: Creating a Custom Agent

### Agent Configuration Structure

Custom agents are defined using YAML configuration files with markdown instructions:

```yaml
---
name: Agent Name
description: A brief description of what this agent does
---

Detailed instructions for how the agent should behave.
This is where you define the agent's expertise and approach.
```

### Step 2.1: Create Your First Agent

Let's create a TypeScript expert agent for the PixelPerfect Gallery project.

#### Instructions:

1. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code

2. **Click the settings gear icon (⚙️)** at the top of the Copilot Chat panel

3. **Select "Custom Agents"** from the menu

4. **Click "New Custom Agent"**

5. **Choose the location**: Select `.github/agents`

6. **Name the file**: Enter `typescript-expert` (the `.agent.md` extension will be added automatically)

   This creates a file at `.github/agents/typescript-expert.agent.md`

7. **Replace the template content** with the TypeScript expert agent configuration

   You can find the complete configuration in [docs/agents/typescript-expert.md](../../docs/agents/typescript-expert.md). Copy the configuration from that file into your new agent file.

### Step 2.2: Test Your Agent

Custom agents are available in VS Code, the Copilot CLI, and with Copilot Coding Agent.

#### Using in VS Code:

1. **Open Copilot Chat** in VS Code
2. **Select your custom agent** from the mode dropdown
3. **Test with a prompt**:

   ```
   Review the photo gallery components and suggest improvements for type safety
   ```

#### Using with Copilot CLI:

If you have the Copilot CLI installed:

1. Run `copilot` to start an interactive session
    - If necessary go through the first start requirements (I.e. authenticating, configuring terminal, etc.)
2. Run 
```bash
agent typescript-expert "Review the photo gallery components and suggest improvements for type safety"
```

#### Using with Copilot Coding Agent:

In Lab 9, you'll learn how to delegate tasks to Copilot Coding Agent and can select this custom agent as part of that workflow.
